# Keras Model Deployment Using Django
  This is a very simple Django web application as a deployment of Keras deep learning model.
  The deep learning model has been implemented using Keras and Tensorflow. It is a CNN based 
  multiclass image classifier consisting of 38 classes of different healthy and diseased plant
  leaves.

# Requirements:
  0. Python
  1. Tensorflow
  2. Keras
  3. Django
